# Machine-Learning-algorithms-from-scratch
This repository contains implementations of fundamental machine learning algorithms built 
from scratch without relying on high-level libraries. The primary goal is to understand the 
inner workings of these algorithms and evaluate their performance on various datasets.

## Implemented Algorithms
- Logistic Regression
- Naive Bayes Classifier
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- K-Means Clustering
- K-Fold Cross-Validation

## Features
**Pure Python Implementations:** All algorithms are implemented using basic Python and numpy, 
providing transparency into each step of the computation. 
**Performance Evaluation:** The models are tested on different datasets to calculate key performance
metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.

## Performance Metrics
For each algorithm and dataset combination, the following metrics are computed:

- **Accuracy:** The proportion of true results among the total number of cases examined.
- **Precision:** The ability of a model to identify only the relevant data points.
- **Recall:** The ability of a model to find all the relevant cases within a dataset.
- **F1-Score:** The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between the two.

## Motivation
Understanding the fundamentals of machine learning algorithms by implementing them from 
scratch enhances comprehension of their mechanics, strengths, and limitations. This repository 
serves as a learning tool and a foundation for further exploration into more complex models 
and techniques.

**Contains zip folders for each algorithm, including code and datasets.**
